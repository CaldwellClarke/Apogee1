                                You’ll create an event that includes a description, time, number of fans that can participate, entry type, and price. Once the event is created, fans can purchase, bid on, or enter a lottery for the opportunity to participate. Once they are confirmed as participants, either upon purchasing the event or winning a lottery or auction, they will have access to the on-event messenger, where you can pass whatever information you need back and forth, like usernames or Discord links. Events close, meaning they no longer accept entrants and choose auction and lottery winners, 10 minutes before the specified event time.

                                First, hit the create new event button in the navbar. Then, enter a title, description, time, number of fans that can participate, event type, price, and thumbnail. The title is a short description of your event and is displayed at all times with the event. The description is a more detailed explanation of the event and of any requirements you may have, like a certain level or role in a game. You can also specify how long you will be playing for, if you might switch games, or any other details you think are worth sharing. The time indicates when the event will actually take place. All events stop accepting entrants 10 minutes before this time. Number of fans specifies how many people can play. For example, if you were playing 4-person squads, you’d allow three fans to purchase or win. For lotteries, you can also specify how many people can enter the lottery to ensure that the odds of winning don’t drop too low. The event type specifies how people win. It can be a purchase, bid, or lottery.

                                There are three different event types: Buy, bid and lottery. Buy is a first-come-first-serve purchase. You set a price and the number of purchases that can be made, and the first set of fans to pay that price are part of your event. Bid is a traditional auction. You specify a starting bid and the number of winners, and ten minutes before the event starts, the highest bids are entered into your event. Lottery is a normal raffle. You specify a price, the number of people that can enter, the raffle, and the number that can win. When the maximum number of people enter, or 10 minutes before the event is set to happen, we randomly pick the winners.

                                If you don’t want to host a gaming event, you could watch sports, esports, tv shows, in a call together. You could discuss political events or other topics you might find interesting. Another option would be to host someone else’s stream while you have some downtime (maybe you need to run to the grocery store or do errands for an hour). You could even create an event to play with fans AND host the fan’s stream. It’s really up to you, so get creative!

                                Fans must file a complaint first. We’ll then contact you to review the situation. Recording your event in some way will provide concrete evidence of what happened.

                                Generally, yes. If only one refund was issued, it would open up opportunities to exploit events. In special cases, we may not issue refunds to everyone.

You purchase the event for the set price and are guaranteed a spot. The messenger becomes available to you immediately. Bid is a traditional auction. The page will list the minimum bid. You can be outbid at any time before the event closes. Lottery is a normal raffle. You buy a ticket for the set price, and winners are randomly selected when the event is filled or 10 minutes before the event starts.

For buy and lottery events, just click on the “Join” or “Buy” button. If you have enough money in your account, you’ll purchase the event or be entered into the lottery. For bid, enter the minimum bid or greater and submit your bid. If it is not high enough, you’ll need to enter the new minimum. Because bids come in extremely quickly, the minimum bid displayed may not be up to date. To win a bid event, you will have to have one of the high bids when it closes. Events close, meaning purchases and bids are no longer accepted and the winners are chosen for lotteries and auctions, 10 minutes before the event begins.

However, if you encounter any inappropriate or abusive behavior from the creator and are forced to leave the event, you may request a refund. You can also request a refund if the creator does not show or if they completely deviate from the event description. To avoid seeing any events from a particular person, we have a block function on individual profiles.
