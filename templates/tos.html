			<p class='mb-3'><strong>5.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Acceptable Use.</strong> You agree not to use the Services in any manner that violates this Agreement.

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>6.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Account and Registration.</strong> To access the features of the Services You must register for an account. When You register for an account, You may be required to provide us with some information about yourself (such as your e-mail address or other contact information). You represent to us that the information you provide to us is and will be accurate and up-to-date at all times. When You register, You will be asked to designate a username and provide a password.

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>7.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Events.</strong> Granite lists available opportunities for You to participate in previously scheduled online video gaming sessions attended by other end users (each an “Event”).  Participation in each Event is subject to any terms specified in the Event’s listing.  You may apply to participate in an Event using the Services, but the Event’s terms define how you will attend the Event.  Granite does not conduct Events nor host any software facilitating an Event; Granite is only the Event organizer.  You acknowledge you are responsible for obtaining access to gaming systems, gaming software, Internet access, and any other instruments necessary to participate in the Event, and Granite has no obligation to provide the foregoing.  Participation in some Events are offered free of charge while other Events may require a fee to participate (each an “Event Fee”).  In order to participate in an Event requiring an Event Fee, You must pay the Event Fee to Granite.  The Event’s terms may specify a static Event Fee, participation by lottery, or participation opportunities may be available at auction and some Events may have a cap on the number of participants.  We offer the opportunity for users who create Events requiring an Event Fee to receive compensation (“Registered Event Creator(s)”).  You understand that You are purchasing the right to participate in the Event from Granite and not from a Registered Event Creator.  All Registered Event Creators are third-parties providing a service to Granite.</p>
			<p class='mb-3'>Each Event may be cancelled at any time by Granite.  At any time and in Granite’s sole discretion, Granite may: (i) determine whether or not you are eligible to participate in an Event, or (ii) remove you from the list of Event participants.  Granite encourages all end users and Registered Event Creators to record Events they participate in.  By participating in any Event, You consent to being recorded.</p>

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>8.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Third-Party Payment Providers.</strong> Your username and password will provide access to Your Granite account where You may purchase credits using any of the payment processors we make available within the Platform (e.g., PayPal).  You may then use those credits to pay Event Fees. You acknowledge You are subject to additional terms and conditions associated to your account with such payment processor.</p>

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>9.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Refunds.</strong> Provided Granite has received an Event Fee from You for participation in a specific Event, Granite will provide a credit to Your Granite account in the amount of the Event Fee for the specific Event when (i) Granite determines You are not eligible to participate in the specific Event, (ii) You are removed from that specific Event’s participant list, (iii) Granite cancels the specific Event, or (iv) the specific Event does not occur for reasons other than your failure to participate in the specific Event.  No refund will be granted for any Event(s) should you violate of our Code of Conduct prior to or during said Event(s).</p>

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>10.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Claims.</strong> If you have a complaint regarding an Event, within seventy two (72) hours of the scheduled start time you must either: (i) use the Services to flag the Event, or (ii) contact us using the contact information provided in Section 29.  Based on Your complaint, Granite may suspend or terminate other end users’ accounts and if appropriate, and at Granite’s sole discretion, we may provide You a credit or refund for the Event Fee paid.  You acknowledge that if You have not submitted a complaint within 72 hours of the scheduled start time of the Event you waive your right to request a refund and no credit will be provided.</p>

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>11.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Third Party Trademarks and Content; Copyright Agent.</strong> You acknowledge that the Services may display information, advertisements, media and trademarks provided to Us by third parties (collectively, “Third-Party Content”).

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>13.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Third-Party Websites and Services.</strong> The Services may contain links to websites and/or services not operated by Granite.

You understand that by using the Services You may be exposed to third-party content that You find offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable. Granite makes no warranty, representation, endorsement, or guarantee regarding any such third-party websites, any products or services accessible through such third-party websites, or any other third-party services.

Granite encourages You to review the terms of use and privacy policies of all third-party websites You visit.</p>

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>14.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Registered Event Creator Applications.</strong> Subject to Granite’s approval, end users may apply to be a Registered Event Creator.  In order to apply to be a Registered Event Creator you must submit an application using the Registered Event Creator registration features in the Services and must provide all information requested by Granite as part of the registration process, which may include, e.g., Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form I-9.  Granite, at its sole discretion, may approve or deny end user applications to be a Registered Event Creator.  Once approved, Granite may at any time revoke a user’s Registered Event Creator status.</p>

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>15.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Proposed Events.</strong> If your application is accepted by Granite you will have access to certain features of the Services available only to Registered Event Creators, including features that enable proposal of Events where the Registered Event Creator receives a fee as designated in our published fee policy.  Each Event proposal must include all information we require such as date, time and other event details (collectively the “Event Terms”).  If the proposed Event is approved by Granite, the Registered Event Creator agrees to participate in the Event according to the Event Terms.  Granite, at its sole discretion, may deny or propose modifications to the Event Terms.  The Registered Event Creator will not be required to perform modified Event Terms until the Registered Event Creator has agreed to the modifications.</p>

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>16.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>User Participation.</strong> Events approved by Granite, or Event Terms modified by Granite and agreed to by the Registered Event Creator, may be advertised through the Services.  When an Event is advertised through the Services, end users of the Services may elect to participate in the Event.  All Events approved by Granite may be cancelled by Granite at any time.  The Registered Event Creator will not receive the fee designated in our published fee policy for any Events (i) cancelled by Granite, (ii) having zero participants, or (iii) not occurring according to the Event Terms.</p>

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>17.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Subcontractor Relationship.</strong> The Registered Event Creator shall perform pursuant to the terms and conditions specifically set forth in this Agreement and the Event Terms.  In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Event Terms, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail.  The Registered Event Creator, acting as an independent contractor and not as an agent for Granite, shall furnish all supplies, personnel and services and all things necessary for, or incident to, performance of the Event, for the consideration designated in our published fee policy.  It is understood and agreed that the Registered Event Creator shall not be considered Granite’s employee.  Accordingly, the Registered Event Creator shall have sole responsibility for paying taxes applicable to the fees received by the Registered Event Creator and other amounts due under applicable laws and regulations.</p>

			<p class='mb-3'><strong>18.</strong> <strong class='mx-1'>Registered Event Creator’s Payment.</strong> In consideration for the Registered Event Creator’s performance in accordance with this Agreement, Granite will deposit a credit in the Registered Event Creator’s Granite account in accordance with our published fee policy in effect at the time of the applicable Event in which the Registered Event Creator participated.  We reserve the right to update the fee policy from time to time.  Credits will be deposited within a reasonable time following the applicable event in which the Registered Event Creator participated, in accordance with our fee policy in effect at the time of the Event.
